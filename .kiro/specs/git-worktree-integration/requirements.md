# Git Worktree Integration Requirements

## Introduction

Tích hợp Git worktree vào task management system để cho phép người dùng tạo và quản lý multiple working directories từ cùng một repository. Mỗi worktree có thể được liên kết với một task cụ thể, giúp tổ chức công việc tốt hơn và cho phép làm việc song song trên nhiều branch/task.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task-based Worktree Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a worktree directly from a task, so that I can work on that specific task in an isolated environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a task detail THEN the system SHALL display a "Create Worktree" button
2. WHEN clicking "Create Worktree" button THEN the system SHALL create a new worktree with name based on task title
3. WHEN creating worktree THEN the system SHALL use current branch as base branch
4. WHEN worktree is created successfully THEN the system SHALL link the worktree to the task
5. WHEN worktree creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message
6. WHEN task already has a worktree THEN the system SHALL show "Open Worktree" instead of "Create Worktree"

### Requirement 2: Worktree Management Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dedicated interface to manage all worktrees, so that I can perform CRUD operations and merge operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing worktree management interface THEN the system SHALL display all existing worktrees
2. WHEN viewing worktree list THEN the system SHALL show worktree name, path, branch, linked task, and status
3. WHEN selecting a worktree THEN the system SHALL provide options to: delete, merge, open in file explorer
4. WHEN deleting a worktree THEN the system SHALL confirm action and remove worktree safely
5. WHEN merging a worktree THEN the system SHALL provide merge options and execute git merge commands
6. WHEN worktree has uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL warn user before deletion
7. WHEN worktree operations fail THEN the system SHALL display detailed error messages

### Requirement 3: Sidebar Worktree Section

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all worktrees in the sidebar, so that I can quickly access and manage them without navigating to a separate page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the sidebar THEN the system SHALL display a "Worktrees" section below Statistics
2. WHEN worktrees exist THEN the system SHALL list all worktrees with their linked tasks
3. WHEN clicking on a worktree THEN the system SHALL open the worktree management interface
4. WHEN worktree has uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator
5. WHEN worktree is behind/ahead of remote THEN the system SHALL show sync status
6. WHEN no worktrees exist THEN the system SHALL display "No worktrees" message
7. WHEN worktree count exceeds display limit THEN the system SHALL show "View All" link

### Requirement 4: Command Interface Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a command interface similar to "Send Command to Claude" for worktree operations, so that I can execute git worktree commands with a user-friendly interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing worktree command interface THEN the system SHALL provide predefined worktree commands
2. WHEN selecting "Create Worktree" command THEN the system SHALL show form with: name, branch, path options
3. WHEN selecting "Delete Worktree" command THEN the system SHALL show dropdown of existing worktrees
4. WHEN selecting "Merge Worktree" command THEN the system SHALL show merge options and target branch
5. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL display command output in real-time
6. WHEN command execution completes THEN the system SHALL refresh worktree list automatically
7. WHEN command fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggested solutions

### Requirement 5: Worktree Status Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the status of each worktree, so that I can understand what changes exist and what actions are needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing worktree information THEN the system SHALL display git status (clean, modified, staged, etc.)
2. WHEN worktree has uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL show number of modified files
3. WHEN worktree is ahead/behind remote THEN the system SHALL display commit count difference
4. WHEN worktree has conflicts THEN the system SHALL highlight conflict status
5. WHEN worktree branch doesn't exist on remote THEN the system SHALL indicate unpushed branch
6. WHEN worktree is stale (not accessed recently) THEN the system SHALL suggest cleanup
7. WHEN worktree status check fails THEN the system SHALL show last known status with warning

### Requirement 6: Task-Worktree Linking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tasks to be automatically linked with their worktrees, so that I can easily navigate between task details and the corresponding code workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating worktree from task THEN the system SHALL establish bidirectional link
2. WHEN viewing task with linked worktree THEN the system SHALL display worktree status and quick actions
3. WHEN viewing worktree THEN the system SHALL show linked task information
4. WHEN task is completed THEN the system SHALL suggest worktree cleanup
5. WHEN worktree is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove link from task
6. WHEN multiple worktrees exist for same task THEN the system SHALL list all linked worktrees
7. WHEN worktree exists without task link THEN the system SHALL allow manual linking

### Requirement 7: Safety and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to prevent dangerous operations and validate inputs, so that I don't accidentally lose work or corrupt the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating worktree THEN the system SHALL validate worktree name and path
2. WHEN deleting worktree with uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation
3. WHEN merging worktree THEN the system SHALL check for conflicts and warn user
4. WHEN worktree path conflicts with existing directory THEN the system SHALL prevent creation
5. WHEN git repository is in invalid state THEN the system SHALL disable worktree operations
6. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL disable remote-dependent operations
7. WHEN user lacks file system permissions THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message
